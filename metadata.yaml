description: 'In the South Seas is a collection of Robert Louis Stevenson''s articles
  and essays on his travels in the Pacific. In his words: "For nearly ten years my
  health had been declining; and for some while before I set forth upon my voyage,
  I believed I was come to the afterpiece of life, and had only the nurse and undertaker
  to expect. It was suggested that I should try the South Seas; and I was not unwilling
  to visit like a ghost, and be carried like a bale, among scenes that had attracted
  me in youth and health. I chartered accordingly Dr. Merrit''s schooner yacht, the
  Casco, seventy-four tons.'
